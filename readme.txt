Guess The Number – This could be a fun Python project for groups or events where you need to randomly generate a number, say between 0 and 20. It can be used to conduct lotteries, in place of board game dice (or build a dice roller below), or just between players to guess a random number. Skills used: Getting familiar with the random function, variables, integers, print, if/else, and while loops.
